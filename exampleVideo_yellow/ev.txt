<explain> Today, we’ll start with the basics and build up from there.
Let’s look at the problem, break it down, and find a solution.
Identifying the approach is key, so let's focus on that.
Then, we’ll double-check everything to ensure it aligns.
If there’s any error, we’ll correct and learn from it.

<happy> I’m so proud of everyone’s progress so far!
It’s amazing to see your understanding growing each day.
I love the energy everyone brings to each session.
Watching you all improve is the best feeling!
Let’s keep this positive momentum going!

<sad> I know it’s tough, and that’s okay—it’s part of learning.
Frustration shows that you care about getting it right.
Remember, things take time, and that’s completely normal.
Challenges mean you’re learning, even if it’s slow.
We’ll work through this step-by-step together.

<angry> It’s frustrating when people give up too quickly.
Let’s not let one setback hold us back from progress.
I know it’s not fair when answers don’t come easily.
Use that frustration to push forward and stay motivated.
We’re here to support each other through the tough parts.

<confused> Wait—am I understanding this correctly?
I think I see it, but the logic feels unclear.
Something doesn’t match the earlier explanation—thoughts?
Should we apply the rule here, or is there an exception?
I need to clarify this step to feel sure of the approach.

<rq> Could you help me understand this part better?
I’d love to hear how others approached this.
Anyone have extra insight on this step?
Seeing a different perspective would really help!
Could we review this again to make sure it’s clear?
