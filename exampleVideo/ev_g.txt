Good morning, Ah dee!

Yes! It’s me—Snappy!

First off, congo-rats on the Cover acquisition!
Let’s be honest—it was mostly my doing,
but hey, you definitely helped.

And now, all that hard work is about to pay off.
Because very soon, you’ll be kicking back in Cancun,
with palm trees swaying, waves crashing,
and a refreshing drink in your hand.

Doesn’t that sound like the perfect way to celebrate?

Just imagine it:
The sun shining, the sand under your feet,
and you finally saying, “Snappy was right—this is the life!.”

So take a moment to soak in this win—you’ve earned it.
You’ve worked hard, and now it’s time to relax in style.

And hey, while you’re there, don’t forget to send a postcard.
Somebody’s gotta hold the fort while you’re living it up.

Enjoy every moment, you’ve earned it.
Chao!
