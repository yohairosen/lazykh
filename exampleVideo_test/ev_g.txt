So.
I up loaded a video show casing my polished planets
cause I also added
five other planets
in twenty twelve!
And although it went under the radar for quite a few years
Yeah, eventually, it became my most viewed video!
but why am I returning
to this topic, eight years later?

Well, back then,
I didn't really want, or know, how to share my world files online,
so I thought the video, alone, was enough.
Now, with a new perspective,
and wanting to be more collaborative, in the you tube online world,
I'm coming to the realization that,
it would be really cool, to see other Mine craft players
playing around, with my giant Earth.
in their own creative ways.
So, I'll put links to download all the world files, in the description.
So you guys can play with it!
Remember, it's got four times the blocks, six times the planets, and a hundred times the caring es than that other world.

And, uh, I I know that Pep in f t asses one to one Earth replica
will blow my earth out of the water when it's done,
but they're not quite done yet!

I'll also put the yo sam itty and men juror sponge world files online,
but not the pock will bells Cannon in Mine craft, or
slope Desert worlds, since those rely on mod, that are defunct now.

I also want to say thanks, to moe hang and Notch for making world files backward compatible,
because I was worried for the longest time
that my world files from Mine craft one point two,
would be super difficult to convert into the modern Mine craft one point sixteen.
But in truth, it couldn't have been easier!

Back on the topic of the planets world.
In the last week,
I've also manually added
maybe fifteen to twenty new objects to the size comparison arena,
since I am the Scale of the Universe guy, I guess.
So I thought it might be fun to use this video to show them off to you!
So let's jump back in to mine craft.
